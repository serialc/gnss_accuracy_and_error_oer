# GNSS accuracy & error

## Introduction

A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), also commonly called a Global Positioning System (GPS) which is actually a brand of GNSS, is a relatively easy and affordable way to georeference points.
Georeferencing is the process of associating points on the surface of the Earth to a standardized coordinate system.
This allows us to say the Eiffel Tower is located at 29.9792° N, 31.1342° E using the WGS 84 geographic coordinate system.
This is typically just referred to as a latitude and longitude without any thought to what geographic coordinate system we are using.
While lat/long coordinates can be [extremely precise](https://xkcd.com/2170/) the question this resource aims to explore is how *accurate* are GNSS recording devices and what impacts their accuracy.

A brief reminder of the difference between **accuracy** and **precision**:

| Value | Measurement | Definition |
|---|---|---|
|2.4173|2.9325|Precise but not accurate|
|2.4173|2.4|Accurate but not precise|
|2.4173|2.417|Accurate and precise|

Admittedly some confusion and convergence between the two terms' meanings can occur when precision decreases for an accurate measurement (e.g., the value 2.4173 reported as 2).

See an [alternative example](https://xkcd.com/2300/).

## Outline
This resource will analyze through exploration the accuracy and error of location data collected along a walk through Belval, LUxembourg, using a GNSS device (Crosscall Trekker-M1 Core).

## Actual path
Below is a walked tour through and in the vicinity of Belval, starting in the east next to the furnaces, going along the shopping center, then to the Park to the west and returning, ending in front of the University of LUxembourg's Maison des Sciences Humaines.

Note that the walked path starts and ends in an urban area with tall structures, with some travel trough open green spaces in-between.

The path in the figure above (green line) was manually digitized using QGIS according to the route taken.

## Sensed path - GNSS data

GNSS devices decode satellite signals to determine their location.
The process locates, with some error, the device's location by determining satellite distances (called trilateration).
This decoding process creates a diversity of data, such as device location (lat/long), elevation, and various error measures, among others.
This data in its raw form is called NMEA data after the organization that defined the standard, the National Marine Electronics Association. There are different versions of the standard.
Rather than nicely structured, NMEA data can be quite messy or corrupted and needs further refinement before being easily usable.
Many devices and data analysis tools will process the NMEA data for you so that it is already comprehensible in data or visual form.

**Code snippet 1: Some NMEA data sentences.**

We captured the NMEA sentences with an Android smartphone App called NMEA Tools Version 2.7.35.
The NMEA data was [processed using a Python script to extract](processing/extract_nmea_data.py) the lat/long points and other data.
In the figure below the lat/long points are added to the map of the walked path.

Note that points can easily be mapped or graphed as lines as well as points.
While using lines is beneficial in showing continuity or direction, lines can also obscure points that communicate information, such as the accuracy of data (a straight line can either mean a straight path or missing data) or changes in speed (the difference in distance between points recorded at regular time intervals).

The maps and figures will show point and line data as appropriate.

**Figure 2: Overlay of GNSS sensed path over walked path.**

NEED A NORTH ARROW - REREND AND EXPORT DIRECTLY FROM QGIS

In the figure above we see the GNSS device data following closely the taken path in the western area, but less so in the south-eastern half where more buildings are present.

Temporally, in the graph below, we can see that there is a lot of deviation from the taken path at the start and end of the walk.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dferr <- read.table("./processing/trace_data/BelvalWT-snap-deviation.csv", sep = ",", header = T)
dferr$dt <- strptime(paste("2022-10-27", dferr$time), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz="UTC")

# plot
par(mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(dferr$dt, dferr$deviation, type = "n", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Deviation from trace (m)")
abline(h=1:3*10, col="grey")
lines(dferr$dt, dferr$deviation, lwd=2)
```

**Figure 3: Plot of distance error between traced and sensed paths over time.**

## What causes error?

Since GNSS accuracy depends on receiving satellite signals, interference between these and the sensor will increase error. Buildings are a common cause of location error, but forests and topography can also degrade, reflect, or block satellite signals.

```{r satcount along route, echo=FALSE}

ll <- read.csv2('processing/ll_data/20221027-Crosscall-nmea.csv', sep=',')
as <- read.csv2('processing/as_data/20221027-Crosscall-nmea.csv', sep=',')

ll$dt <- strptime(paste(ll$date, ll$time), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S Z", tz="UTC")

# merge both to get dt in as
m <- merge(ll, as, by="llid", all.x=TRUE)

#plot(m$dt, m$satused, cex=0.5, pch=19)
# too fuzzy

# smooth out the number of satellites used
filter_size = 10
m$satused_filt <- filter(m$satused, filter = rep(1/filter_size, filter_size))

par(mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(dferr$dt, dferr$deviation, type = "n", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Deviation from trace (m)")
abline(h=1:3*10, col="grey")
lines(dferr$dt, dferr$deviation, lwd=2)

par(new=TRUE, mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(m$dt, m$satused_filt, xlab = "", ylab = "", xaxt='n', yaxt='n', col="white", lwd=4, type='l')
lines(m$dt, m$satused_filt, col=4, lwd=2, type='l')
axis(4, at=0:3*4, labels = 0:3*4, col.axis=4)
mtext(side=4, line = 2, "Number of satellite signals received (smoothed)", col=4)

```

**Figure 4: The error and number of satellites used to locate the sensor.**

It appears that the number of satellites signals received decreases at times of higher error.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mv <- read.csv2('processing/mv_data/20221027-Crosscall-nmea.csv', sep=',')
mv$spd_ms <- as.numeric(mv$spd_ms)

# merge both to get dt in mv
m <- merge(ll, mv, by="llid", all.x=TRUE)

m$spd_kmh <- m$spd_ms*3.6
filter_size = 20
m$spd_filt <- filter(m$spd_kmh, filter = rep(1/filter_size, filter_size))

par(mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(dferr$dt, dferr$deviation, type = "n", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Deviation from trace (m)")
abline(h=1:3*10, col="grey")
lines(dferr$dt, dferr$deviation, lwd=2)

par(new=TRUE, mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(m$dt.x, m$spd_filt, xlab = "", ylab = "", xaxt='n', yaxt='n', col="white", lwd=4, type='l')
lines(m$dt.x, m$spd_filt, col=3, lwd=2, type='l')
axis(4, at=0:10*.6, labels = 0:10*.6, col.axis = 3)
mtext(side=4, line = 2, "Walking speed (km/h)", col=3)
```

As buildings interfere with GNSS precision let's visualize building heights along the walked route.

(ADD AN IFRAME TO CONTAIN THIS and then a link to the full page visualization)
[see GPS path and 3D buildings](https://map.geoportail.lu/theme/main?bgLayer=basemap_2015_global&version=3&zoom=14&X=661470&Y=6361338&lang=en&rotation=0&layers=&opacities=&crosshair=false&3d_layers=ACT2022_BD_L_BATI3D_LOD2%2CVDL2022_LOD2_IMPORT_old%2CBridges_LOD2%2CACT2019_LiDAR_Bridges_LOD1%2CACT2019_LiDAR_Vegetation&3d_enabled=true&3d_lon=5.94209&3d_lat=49.49240&3d_elevation=1385&3d_heading=360.000&3d_pitch=-40.388&map_id=3a4b6e155fce4f448337ebe41ed6c005&embedded=true)

We can view this similarly to earlier graphs as well.
Below, the mean height of the 50m around each recorded location is overlaid on the error.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# buildings heights data
dfs <- read.table("./processing/trace_data/BelvalWT-snap-height_stats0.csv", sep = ",", header = T)
df <- merge(dferr, dfs[,c("rid", "X_count", "X_sum",  "X_mean", "X_median", "X_stdev", "X_min", "X_max")], by = "rid")

par(mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(df$dt, df$deviation, type = "n", lwd=2, xlab = "Time (minutes)", ylab = "Deviation from trace (m)")
abline(h=1:3*10, col="grey")
lines(df$dt, df$deviation, lwd=2)
lines(df$dt, df$X_mean, col="white", lwd=4)
lines(df$dt, df$X_mean, col=2, lwd=2)
axis(4, at=0:3*10, labels = 0:3*10, col.axis=2)
mtext(side=4,line = 2, "Surrounding mean height within 50 metres (m)", col=2)
legend('topleft', legend = c("Error distance", "Mean surrounding (50m) height of location"), lwd=2, col=c(1,2))

```
**Figure 4: Plot of surrounding building heights and error along the walked path.**

Clearly the distance between the know path and the sensed path, increases according to the surrounding structure heights.

As expected surrounding structures reduce the GNSS sensing device accuracy.

## The number of satellites

As mentioned in the introduction, GPS, is the brand of the American GNSS system. Other systems exists such as GLONASS (Russia), Baedou (China), and Galileo (EU). As location accuracy is dependent on getting good satellite reception, clearly having more satellites accessible can be beneficial. Some GNSS devices can track multiple satellites types.

**Figure X: Sky plots of satellites in view while completing walk, with only GPS satellites and with GPS and GLONASS satellites.**

## Dynamic satellite selection

While many satellites may be detected by a GNSS device, only up to 12 are used to calculate the location. Depending on reception to satellites as the device and the satellites move, the selection used changes over time.

Other sources of errors: weather, ..

## Notes

- While we used a smartphone app to record NMEA data, this may not the same as using smartphone location data, such as that positioned in Gooble Maps, which may use other measures such as proximity to cellular towers or Wi-Fi hotspots to georeference location.
